I am an aspiring GIS analyst and data scientist. I am passionate about applying my background in GIS, machine learning, and predictive modeling to tackle interdisciplinary problems at the intersection of data and decision-making, while also making complex data accessible to everyone, regardless of educational or cultural background. When I’m not coding you can find me at the nearest fishable body of water trying to catch myself a big one."
