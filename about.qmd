# Experience

### Environmental Outreach Coordinator

**GreenWaste**, Watsonville, CA\
*January 2025 – July 2025*

-   Conducted outreach and education to residents, businesses, and multi-family dwellings to improve recycling and organics compliance in alignment with SB 1383 and local regulations.
-   Performed waste audits and inspections at commercial and multi-family properties, ensuring sites met state and county requirements.
-   Collected, analyzed, and reported compliance data to Santa Cruz County to track program performance and diversion outcomes.
-   Developed and distributed educational materials, including recycling guides and outreach collateral, to promote proper waste sorting and increase diversion rates.
-   Partnered with local officials, community groups, and schools to organize events to promote zero waste goals and strengthen public engagement.

### GIS & Machine Learning Research Intern (NSF REU)

**Biosphere 2**, Oracle, CA\
*June 2024 – August 2024*

-   Used **Machine Learning** (XGBoost, Random Forest Classification, Boosted Regression Trees), **ArcGIS Pro**, and **geospatial data** to develop predictive models for arsenic contamination in groundwater.
-   Designed models to assess risk of exposure for each county in the Colorado Plateau.
-   Evaluated which machine learning model most accurately predicted arsenic contamination.
-   Extracted and cleaned water quality data for GIS; compiled covariate layers (hydrology, geology, and soils) into a raster surface in ArcGIS Pro. Extracted predictor values for each well location.
-   Prepared data for models and created arsenic-level training and testing datasets.
-   Tuned model hyperparameters using **Supercomputing Cluster** and **10-fold cross-validation** for optimal accuracy.
-   Presented research at two scientific conferences.

### Undergraduate Geospatial Researcher

**California State University, Dominguez Hills**, Carson, CA\
*October 2023 – December 2024*

-   Used **spatial data**, **GIS**, and **R** to investigate the causes and consequences of rarity in 14 species of the desert plant *Encelia*. Applied data cleaning methods to filter erroneous geographic coordinates, ensuring accurate distribution maps.
-   Automated mapping in **R** with **ggplot2** and geographic boundary layers to optimize parameters for precise species ranges.
-   Used resulting maps to determine which species were common versus rare.
